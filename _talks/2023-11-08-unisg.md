Group actions are fundamental mathematical tools, both for classical cryptography with discrete logarithm and for post-quantum cryptography, such as isogeny-based and code-based ones. They have received a lot of interest from the cryptographic community, who are also attracted by the possibility of defining additional functionalities over standard primitives. However, different families of group actions may differ significantly in their core characteristics, so some works usually focus on specific schemes, usually with abelian acting groups like CSI-FiSh. In this talk, we have seen some additional functionalities for general cryptographic group actions, particularly the one arising from isomorphism problems in coding theory used in LESS and MEDS signature schemes, such as a threshold implementation and different commitment design strategies.
