A <a href="https://giacomoborin.github.io/files/master/ACA-coding_blank.pdf">presentation</a> (ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§) for the final exam of the course <a href="https://www.esse3.unitn.it/Guide/PaginaADContest.do?ad_cont_id=10170*92614*2021*2009*10002"> Advanced Commutative Algebra </a>. These slides where inspired by the wonderful book <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/9780511982170"> Codes, Cryptology and Curves with Computer Algebra </a> containing two interesting intersections between coding theory and commutative algebra, that I have expanded and inserted in the slides (it is possible to have also the <a href="https://giacomoborin.github.io/works/master/ACA-coding_notes.pdf">annotated version</a>).
The two main arguments are:
  * A general method for decoding Cyclic codes using Groebner basis, called *Cooper's Philosophy*. I have also proposed a working example of the decoding in MAGMA (here the <a href="https://giacomoborin.github.io/files/master/ACA-GB_decoding.mag"> code</a>), where is possible also to change the parameters to obtain different examples. 
  * A link between Matroid and Coding theory, with some easy results.
