For the course <a href='https://www.esse3.unitn.it/Guide/PaginaADContest.do?ad_cont_id=10170*94110*2021*2009*10005'> Applied Crptography </a> I gave a short <a href="https://giacomoborin.github.io/files/master/CT_LEDAcrypt_borin-20211216.pdf">Presentation</a> (ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§) to an audience of engineers and mathematicians about the basics of linear coding theory and its application for post-quantum cryptography. In particular I've explained the key ideas behind McEliece Cryptosystem and one of its implementation: <a href='https://www.ledacrypt.org'> LEDAcrypt </a>. This suite were designed by a group of italian researchers (Marco Baldi, Alessandro Barenghi, Franco Chiaraluce, Gerardo Pelosi, Paolo Santini) and reached the second round of the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography"> NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization process </a>.
