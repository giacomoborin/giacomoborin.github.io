      <p>This project aims to code a LaTeX beamer theme for master’s &amp; bachelor’s degrees of the University of Trento (Italy), but also to provide a quasi-official theme for professors, students, et cetera working or studying at UniTn. As of now, this is a non-official project. The theme can be found in this github repository: <a href="https://github.com/giacomoborin/Beamer-Theme">giacomoborin/Beamer-Theme</a>.</p>

<p>There there are also guidelines for the style and the possibility of contributing to the project.</p>
