<h1 id="liberty">Liberty</h1>
<p>In April 1989, students gathered in Tiananmen Square to demonstrate in favor of liberty and democracy for the Chinese people. Unable to accede to their demands for freedom, the oppressive Chinese government declared martial law and suppressed the protests using violence. Heroically, the young protesters resisted oppression at the cost of their own lives, as they were massacred by the army and tanks on June 4th of the same year.</p>

<p>To this day, the West remains unable to hold the criminal Chinese Communist Party accountable for its crimes. Instead, the party persists in suppressing the freedom of the Chinese people, e.g. by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>concealing the Tiananmen Square massacre and other crimes;</li>
  <li>suppressing Hong Kong protests against forced annexation to the regime;</li>
  <li>threatening violence against the independence of the real Republic of China (Taiwan);</li>
  <li>censoring the internet through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall#:~:text=The%20Great%20Firewall%20(GFW%3B%20simplified,to%20regulate%20the%20Internet%20domestically">Great Firewall</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>As citizens of the Free World, we should always be grateful to all those who, like the anonymous students of Tiananmen Square, fought for freedomâ€”the most important right we possess.</p>
