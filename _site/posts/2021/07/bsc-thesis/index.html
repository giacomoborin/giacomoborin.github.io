<p>My thesis work for the Bachelor Degree in Mathematics: <em>The Containment Problem, a general introduction and the particular case for Steiner systems</em> (<a href="https://giacomoborin.github.io/files/bachelor/borin_elab_fin_digital.pdf">article in digital version</a> and <a href="https://giacomoborin.github.io/files/bachelor/borin_elab_fin_pres.pdf">beamer slideshow</a> (ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§)).</p>

<h1 id="description">Description</h1>
<p>The Containment problem is an open sector of research that focuses on the behaviour of symbolic powers of ideals in relation to the normal powers and touches several disciplines, in particular Algebraic Geometry and Commutative Algebra, but also Combinatorics and Graph Theory. In this essay I have introduced the problem and investigate some connections between these subjects, in particular with reference to the article <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07168"><em>Steiner Configurations ideals: containment and colouring</em></a> with authors Edoardo Ballico (the relator), Giuseppe Favacchio, Elena Guardo, Lorenzo Milazzo, and Abu Chackalamannil Thomas. 
In this essay we will introduce the problem and investigate some connections between these subjects.</p>
