<p>The problem of computing an isogeny of large prime degree from a supersingular elliptic curve of unknown endomorphism ring is assumed to be hard both for classical as well as quantum computers.
In this work, we first build a two-round identification protocol whose security reduces to this problem.  The challenge consists of a random large prime $q$ and the prover simply replies with an efficient representation of an isogeny of degree $q$ from its public key.
Using the hash-and-sign paradigm, we then derive a signature scheme with a very simple and flexible signing procedure and prove its security in the standard model.
Our optimized C implementation of the signature scheme shows that signing is roughly $1.8\times$ faster than all SQIsign variants, whereas verification is $1.4\times$ times slower.  The sizes of the public key and signature are comparable to existing schemes.</p>
